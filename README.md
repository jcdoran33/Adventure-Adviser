# Adventure Advisor

For this project, we decided to make a functional and interactable website that makes finding events near the user easier and more convenient. Whether the events are concerts, sporting events or any other type of events, this website locates the event with precise location, time and date. The precise location of the event(s) are located the map, while the time, date and arena are on the information bars. Additionally, next to the events are clickable buttons that direct the user to ticketmaster to purchase the tickets.
